# Achievement-6
Why this data set was chosen:
I tried to search by myself data, but I understood it might take too much time, thus I have chosen from the available list. 
As I used to work in the marketing department and E-commerce is booming. I found it inspiring to dig into this area.

A summary of my data source
Data Source
In this project I am using an open internal data source provided by Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store, information was collected 2016-2018 at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. 
This is real commercial data, it has been anonymised, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.
Data Collection
Data was collected via an online customer survey. Survey is sent via email, once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due.
Contents
Data provides  customers reviews and comments regarding the purchase experience.

Data limitations and ethics 
- As data was collected via survey and it includes open questions, the data is more prone to erroneous data. What we actually saw during cleaning stage in Reviews table
- As survey is sent via email, email may go to spam and custom may never see it in the inbox (collection bias)
- Data privacy is quite well kept, as there is no user names or other private information that can be easily revealed 

Define questions to explore
- Does product review depend on the category/price/location/seller?
- How often do customers re-order from the seller?
- Do regular customers leave reviews more often?
- The biggest sellers on the market place?
- Sellers with the highest and lowest reviews?
